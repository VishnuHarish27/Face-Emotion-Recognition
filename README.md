# Face-Emotion-Recognition
# Introduction 

The motivation behind choosing this topic specifically lies in the huge investments large corporations do in feedbacks and surveys but fail to get equitable response on their investments.

Emotion Detection through facial gestures is a technology that aims to improve product and services performance by monitoring customer behavior to certain products or service staff by their evaluation.

While Disney uses emotion-detection tech to find out opinion on a completed project, other brands have used it to directly inform advertising and digital marketing.

Kellogg's is just one high-profile example, having used Affectiva's software to test audience reaction to ads for its cereal.

# Proposed System 
Where the data subjectsâ€™ facial expressions are captured in a remote manner, it may not be clear to them which system or application will process their data, for which purposes, and who the controllers are.
 As a result, they would not be in the position to freely give consent or exercise control over the processing of their personal data, including sharing with third-parties. Where data subjects are not provided with accurate information, access and control over the use of FER(Face Emotion Recognition)

# Conclusion 
Face emotion recognition technology is a rapidly advancing field that has the potential to revolutionize various industries, including healthcare, entertainment, and marketing. It involves the use of machine learning algorithms to detect and analyze facial expressions in real-time, enabling computers to accurately identify the emotional state of a person.
Although there are concerns regarding the accuracy and ethics of face emotion recognition, ongoing research and development efforts are focused on improving the technology to address these issues.
